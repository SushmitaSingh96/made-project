## Project Plan

### Title

Climate-induced Disasters- Germany

### Main Question

1. What are the temperature anomaly trends over the years 1961 to 2023 in Germany?
2. Are the temperature anomaly trends similar to previous reports seen across the world? 
3. What natural disasters have struck Germany from 2001 to 2023 and what is the impact?

### Description

Various types of climate-induced disasters threaten countries all over the world today, ranging from hydrological disasters such as floods to climatological disasters such as wildfires. Thus, we must study the patterns of such events and prepare to the best of our abilities to save lives and resources. With this motivation in mind, the dataset chosen for this project is about the types of disasters that have impacted various regions around the world. We will look more closely into Germany to observe which type of disaster Germany is more likely to face as extreme climate events become more common. With the second dataset, we attempt to look more closely into temperature anomalies over the years in Germany. In the end, we attempt to answer the question of whether there is a significant pattern over time in the occurrence of a specific type of disaster and does it have a correlation to the temperature change on land over the years.

### Datasources

#### Datasource1: Public EM-DAT

- Data URL: [https://public.emdat.be/data](https://public.emdat.be/data)
- Data Type: Microsoft Excel

EM-DAT: The International Disaster Database: Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters: EM-DAT contains data on the occurrence and impacts of over 26,000 mass disasters worldwide from 1900 to the present day. The database is compiled from various sources, including UN agencies, non-governmental organizations, reinsurance companies, research institutes, and press agencies. The Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) distributes the data in open access for non-commercial use.

#### Datasource2: Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nation
