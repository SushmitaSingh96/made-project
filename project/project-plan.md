# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Climate-induced Disasters and the Economic Impact

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
What are the types of climate-induced disasters that impact Germany and as a consequence what is the economic loss? 

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Various types of climate-induced disasters threaten countries all over the world today, they range from hydrological disasters such as floods to climatological disasters such as wildfires. It is thus imperitive that we study the patterns of such events and prepare to the best of our abilities to save lives as well as resources. With this motivation in mind, the dataset chosen for this project is about the types of disasters that have impacted various regions around the world. We will look more closely into Germany to observe which type of disaster is Germany more likely to face as extreme climate events become more common. With the second dataset, we attempt to get a scale of economic loss Germany has faced in the year 2022 due to climate related disasters.  

## Datasources
