# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Climate-induced Disasters 

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
What are the types of climate-induced disasters that impact Germany, is there any significant changes or patterns over time in the occurrence of specific types of disasters due to temperature change on land? 

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Various types of climate-induced disasters threaten countries all over the world today, they range from hydrological disasters such as floods to climatological disasters such as wildfires. Thus, we must study the patterns of such events and prepare to the best of our abilities to save lives and resources. With this motivation in mind, the dataset chosen for this project is about the types of disasters that have impacted various regions around the world. We will look more closely into Germany to observe which type of disaster Germany is more likely to face as extreme climate events become more common. With the second dataset, we attempt to look more closely into temperature anomalies over the years in Germany. In the end, we attempt to answer the question of whether there is a significant pattern over time in the occurrence of a specific type of disaster and does it have a correlation to the temperature change on land over the years. 

## Datasources
